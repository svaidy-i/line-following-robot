# line-following-robot

This project uses:
Two 12 volt motors
Three LM18650 batteries
L298 motor controler
Rasberry Pi Pico 
IR Sensors

This code allows for the robot to make turns, loops and owercome most of the common tacks for a Line Following Robot without the integration of PWM keeping the logic of the program simple, However, the robot will be slow because of the same. 
Be sure to have set up micropython on your rasberry pi pico and then proceed to save the code into the pico.
